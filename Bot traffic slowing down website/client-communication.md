âœ…Comm channel (Whatsapp & Google meet)

 Note: Summary was given over a google meet session so this is the summary of the conversation as it was explained.


 " I was able to find out where the problem was, and it happened to be that your site was being attacked by bots. This is usually an automated attack so you get thousands of requests to your server which slows the server down.
 This is why you were having your issue.

 I've blocked the identified the IP's of the bots and also implemented security protocols to monitor and help prevent further occurence. "
