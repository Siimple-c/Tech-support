âœ…Comm channel (Mail & Whatsapp)

Hello, 

I'm glad you reached out to resolve the issue. After some investigation, I confirmed that the site was not setup properly in terms of search, so I had to fix the files responsible for this as well as set you up properly on google search console.

Over the next few days, your site should be fully discoverable via search.
Please feel free to reach out if there is any other issue.

Best regards.
