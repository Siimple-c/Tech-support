✅ Firstly I asked to know if they had explicitly checked to see if their sitemap was configured before, to which they answered yes.

✅ Next I confirmed if the sitemap was accessible or properly referenced. 
Once I validated this using [cURL], I used [Yoast SEO] to verify the sitemap.

✅ I then corrected the [robots.txt] to include the sitemap path, flushed the caches and resubmitted the sitemap on google search console.
