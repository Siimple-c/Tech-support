Hello, 

Your site got into a frozen state because one of because one of the updates didn't complete preoperly, leaving behind a system file called [.maintenance] that's supposed to auto-delete. 
I've manually removed it and your site is back online. Going forward, I recommend updating plugins individually to avoid this, or you can use a staging site where updates can be tested safely before going to the live site. If you need help with the staging site, please feel free to reach out.

Regards.
