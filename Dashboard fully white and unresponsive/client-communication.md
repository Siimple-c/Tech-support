✅Comm channel (whatsapp)

Thanks for the heads-up. I’ve looked into the white screen issue you mentioned. It turns out it was being caused by a PHP error in the **name witheld** plugin. These types of errors don't show anything obvious, they just quietly break the dashboard.

The plugin has been removed and replaced with an alternative so you can log in again.
