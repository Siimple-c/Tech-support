Report summary:

Hello, 

Based on the timeout error, your FTP client (Filezilla) was using a configuration that your local firewall didn't allow (active mode). I've fixed this and allowed FTP traffic through your firewall.
I have also attached a reference guide on this in case you encounter this issue again.
If you need help with anything else, please let me know and I'll jump right in.

Regards.
