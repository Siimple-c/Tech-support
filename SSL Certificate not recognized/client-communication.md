Hello, 

The issue was as a result of your SSL certificate being partially installed. The intermediate certificate wasn't included and some browsers flagged this because they require it to verify your sites identity.

The issue has now been completely resolved and you can browse freely. All visitors across all devices and browsers will now have unhindered access to the site.

Warm Regards.
